# Agent Script Recipes

A comprehensive collection of **26 recipes** for learning Agent Script - from basic concepts to production-ready patterns.

**✅ All 3 Phases Complete!** Every recipe includes working code, comprehensive documentation, and real-world examples.

## What are Agent Script Recipes?

Recipes are **standalone, working examples** that teach specific Agent Script concepts. Each recipe includes:

- **Working `.agent` file** with comprehensive inline documentation
- **Salesforce bundle metadata** (`.bundle-meta.xml`) for deployment
- **Detailed README** explaining concepts, patterns, and best practices
- **Try It Out examples** showing real conversations
- **Testing guidance** for validation

Think of these as cookbooks for building agents - each recipe focuses on one concept you can learn, adapt, and apply to your own agents.

## How to Use These Recipes

Recipes are organized into **4 progressive categories** that mirror your learning journey from basics to production-ready agents.

### 📁 01_languageEssentials

**Start here!** Master the core Agent Script syntax and fundamental building blocks.

- **HelloWorld** - Your first agent: understand `config`, `system`, and `topic` blocks
- **VariableManagement** - Working with state: mutable vs readonly(linked) variables, and variable types
- **TemplateExpressions** - Dynamic content with `{!}` syntax, conditionals and expressions
- **SystemInstructionOverrides** - Customize system prompts per topic for advanced control

**Recommended order:** HelloWorld → VariableManagement → TemplateExpressions → SystemInstructionOverrides

### 📁 02_actionConfiguration

**Connect to the world!** Learn how agents interact with external systems and Salesforce.

- **ActionDefinitions** - Define actions, inputs/outputs, and connect to Flows/Apex
- **ActionCallbacks** - Process action results and chain operations (one-level)
- **AdvancedInputBindings** - Master fixed, bound, and LLM-filled parameters (called slots)
- **ActionDescriptionOverrides** - Provide context-specific action descriptions
- **PromptTemplateActions** - Invoke Salesforce Prompt Templates as an action

**Recommended order:** ActionDefinitions → ActionCallbacks → AdvancedInputBindings → ActionDescriptionOverrides, then explore based on your needs

### 📁 03_reasoningMechanics

**Build intelligence!** Control how your agent thinks, decides, and processes information.

- **ReasoningInstructions** - Procedural instructions with `instructions:->` and `run` actions
- **ContextHandling** - Leverage context data and `readonly` linked variables effectively
- **BeforeAfterReasoning** - Use lifecycle hooks for pre/post-reasoning logic
- **AdvancedReasoningPatterns** - Complex multi-step reasoning and data aggregation

**Recommended order:** ReasoningInstructions → ContextHandling → BeforeAfterReasoning → AdvancedReasoningPatterns

### 📁 04_architecturalPatterns

**Build production systems!** Patterns for real-world applications.

- **SimpleQA** - Single-topic Q&A pattern
- **MultiTopicNavigation** - Orchestrate conversations across multiple topics
- **MultiTopicOrchestration** - Advanced topic coordination strategies
- **BidirectionalNavigation** - Implement supervision patterns with transitions
- **MultiStepWorkflows** - Chain actions and pass data between steps
- **ComplexStateManagement** - Handle complex objects, lists, and state patterns
- **DynamicActionRouting** - Filter actions based on context with `available when`
- **ErrorHandling** - Validation, guard clauses, and error handling patterns
- **SafetyAndGuardrails** - Safety with confirmation patterns
- **ExternalAPIIntegration** - External system integration
- **CustomerServiceAgent** - Complete customer service agent example

**Start with:** SimpleQA → MultiTopicNavigation → ErrorHandling, then explore based on your needs

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Accessing Variables**

```agentscript
{!@variables.variable_name}              # In templates
@variables.variable_name                  # In expressions
set @variables.variable_name = value      # Setting values
```

**Calling Actions**

```agentscript
run @actions.action_name                  # In procedures
   with param=value
   set @variables.result = @outputs.field
```

**Topic Transitions**

```agentscript
transition to @topic.topic_name           # In procedures
@utils.transition with target=@topic.name # As action
```

**Conditionals**

```agentscript
if @variables.condition:                  # In procedures
   | Instructions for true case
else:
   | Instructions for false case

{!if @variables.condition}               # In templates
   Content for true case
{!else}
   Content for false case
{!endif}
```

## Contributing

These recipes are designed to help developers learn Agent Script through practical examples. Each recipe:

- **Is standalone** - Can be understood without reading others
- **Is functional** - Includes working, deployable code
- **Teaches one concept** - Focused on a specific learning objective
- **Follows patterns** - Demonstrates idiomatic Agent Script
- **Is well-documented** - Explains the "why" not just the "what"

## Version

These recipes are based on **Agent Script v1.0.0 syntax**.

Note: The syntax may have small changes based on executive feedback but is largely locked down.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Browse recipes** in order (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
3. **Read the README** for each recipe to understand concepts
4. **Study the `.agent` file** to see patterns in action
5. **Adapt and experiment** - modify recipes for your use cases
6. **Deploy and test** using the included `.bundle-meta.xml` files

Ready to start? Begin with **HelloWorld** to understand the basics, then progress through the foundational recipes at your own pace!
